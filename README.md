_This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting weekly sales data for Walmart stores across the U.S. Using real-world data, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical correlation studies, outlier handling, and predictive modeling to extract business insights and forecast future sales._

**Project Objectives:-**
- Analyze how economic factors like unemployment rate, consumer price index (CPI), and temperature influence sales.
- Identify seasonal trends in weekly sales across different stores.
- Evaluate top and bottom performing stores historically.
- Forecast sales for the next 12 weeks using regression models.

**Key Analyses Performed:-**
- Correlation Analysis: Explored relationships between sales and macroeconomic variables.
- Seasonal Decomposition: Detected repeating patterns in sales over time using additive models.
- Outlier Handling: Addressed extreme values and missing data using imputation and visualization.
- Forecasting: Built a simple yet effective Linear Regression model per store to forecast future weekly sales.
- Store Ranking: Identified stores with highest and lowest average sales, and measured the performance gap.

**Tools & Technologies:-**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels (seasonal decomposition)

**Future Improvements:-**
- Incorporate time series models like ARIMA or Facebook Prophet for more accurate forecasting.
- Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Dash.
- Compare performance of multiple ML models across stores.
- Deploy as a web app or API for real-time predictions.

**Dataset:-**
The dataset contains weekly sales records for various Walmart stores along with external factors like temperature, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment rate.
